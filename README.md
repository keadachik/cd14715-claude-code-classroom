### Setup instructions

```bash
# Install everything
npm install

# Or install only one demo/exercise
npm install --workspace lesson-10-multi-agent-orchestration/demo
```

Run a specific demo/exercise from the repo root:

```bash
npm run --workspace lesson-10-multi-agent-orchestration/demo start
```

You can also `cd` into a demo/exercise folder and run `npm start` after the root install.
